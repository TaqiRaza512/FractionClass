# FractionClass

## Introduction
This repository hosts the implementation of a Fraction class in C++, designed to handle arithmetic operations with fractions effectively.

## Features
- Handling of fraction arithmetic including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Overloaded operators for easy manipulation of fractions.
- Implementation of simplification and normalization of fractions.

## Technologies
- C++

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/TaqiRaza512/FractionClass.git

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.

## Usage
- Include the `Fraction.h` and `Fraction.cpp` in your C++ projects.
- Create Fraction objects and use them to perform fractional arithmetic operations.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance functionality or improve the codebase are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

The FractionClass project is an exploration into implementing custom data types in C++. It demonstrates how to manage mathematical operations and logic within a class structure, providing an excellent learning opportunity for those interested in advanced C++ programming concepts.
